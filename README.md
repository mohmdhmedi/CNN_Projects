Introduction

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are powerful tools for image recognition and classification tasks. This repository showcases various CNN projects that aim to solve different image classification problems. Each project includes code, datasets, and detailed explanations to help you understand and implement CNNs effectively.
Projects


Rice Classification

    Description: This project classifies different types of rice grains using CNNs. The dataset consists of images of five types of rice: Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine, and Karacadag.
    Dataset: The dataset is divided into training, validation, and test sets.
    Techniques Used: Data augmentation, CNN architecture, early stopping, learning rate reduction.
    Framework: TensorFlow/Keras

Project 2

    Description: Description of the second project.
    Dataset: Details about the dataset used.
    Techniques Used: Techniques and methods applied.
    Framework: Framework and libraries used.

Project 3

    Description: Description of the third project.
    Dataset: Details about the dataset used.
    Techniques Used: Techniques and methods applied.
    Framework: Framework and libraries used.
